### Argel Ram√≠rez Reyes. Tropical cyclone modeler.

* I try to understand how tropical cyclones work and form, and in general the atmospheric fluid dynamics.

* Currently, I try and model TC behaviour using statistical methods.

* I like using #JuliaLang and big computers.

* Can I publish my papers with a nice, reproducible code base?
